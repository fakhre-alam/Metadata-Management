# Metadata-Management
##Seminar held By Cdac and Manipal

Metadata provides information on your data and resources. The quality of the metadata directly affects the discoverability and reuse of your the resources. 

 A structured approach should be followed for metadata management. 

The metadata lifecycle extends the lifecycle of datasets (metadata before publication and after deletion). 

 Homogenised metadata enable the operation of metadata brokers, which can in turn lower the access barriers to your resources, leading to improved visibility and discoverability, and thus increasing their reuse potential.
